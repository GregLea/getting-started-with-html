<b>Important Concepts</b><br>
The World Wide Web started early in the 1990s and has grown exponentially since then.<br>
The Web consists of HTML documents, where hyperlinks connect the pages like a web.<br>
HTML or hypertext markup language is the code that runs webpages like this one.<br>
When a person goes to a web page like <a href="www.google.com">Google</a>, their computer sends an HTTP request to a server. <br>
The server finds the right HTML document, and sends it back to the person's computer to be displayed.<br>

<br>
<b>Tags</b><br>
Tags are bits of HTML code that instruct the computer on what to do.<br>
Many tags have an opening tag and a closing tag, but there are a expections to this rule, such as the<br>
tag for a line break.<br>
Tags tell the computer how an HTML document should look.<br>
<br>
<b>Inline or Block elements</b><br>
Some HTML elements are known as inline because the formatting they create<br>
appears inline with the text. Other elemetns are block elements because they make<br>
an invisible box around the content that is placed inside the tags.<br>
<br>
<b>Computers need to be told</b><br>
Computers are stupid in that they need very specific instructions to know what to do.<br>
They literally take everything literally.<br>
